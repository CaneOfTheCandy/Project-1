# Project-1 Organizing and Summarizing Air Quality Data
This includes files for Project No. 1:
Our client UNMC Water, Climate and Health Group, has asked our engineering firm to analyze air quality in Nebraska and its relationship to public health concerns in the region. There are six main factors they'd like us to use in our report: temperature, humidity, elevation, AQI, pollutants, and geographical location. Two of the five questions they urge us to answer involve recording locations with high concentrations of VOC and PM chemicals, and investigating the health risks those populations have been exposed to using the exploratory research provided to us. Values such as humidity and temperature need to be sorted into the categories provided in the prompt. Lastly, all of our results must be grouped by their individual sensor names when applicable, and we must include everything in the formats asked for in the deliverables: an ACD, a link to our GitHub, an SOW, and a final summary. 


## Repo Structure
The repository includes the following files:
- [Raw Data](AirQuality_Daily_StudentVersion.csv)
- [Python Code](Python_Code_UNMC.ipynb)
